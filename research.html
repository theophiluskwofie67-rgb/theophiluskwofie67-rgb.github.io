          <h3>Research statement</h3>
          <p>
            My work sits at the intersection of mathematical epidemiology, applied analysis, and data science.
            I develop mechanistic models that capture key biological and behavioural processes, and I integrate
            these models with modern statistical and machine learning approaches to guide decision-making in
            public and population health.
          </p>
          <p>
            A recurring theme in my research is the importance of <em>trustworthy</em> and <em>interpretable</em>
            models in settings where data are limited, noisy, or structurally biased. I am interested in how
            qualitative model structure, parameter uncertainty, and social context interact to produce complex
            dynamics, and in how we can design interventions that are effective, equitable, and robust to
            modelling assumptions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Methodologically, I work with compartmental and hybrid mechanistic–data-driven models, optimal
            control, sensitivity and uncertainty analysis (including LHS–PRCC pipelines), and numerical simulation.
            Substantively, my projects span infectious diseases, noncommunicable conditions such as obesity, and
            social phenomena such as crime, gang activity, and substance use, viewed through the lens of public
            health.

                This figure presents the model fitting and cross-validation results for the opioid addiction model using West Virginia overdose mortality data from January 2015 to December 2017.
                Panel (a) compares observed monthly mortality (red dots) with the model’s fitted predictions (blue curve) during the training period and the model’s cross-validated projection (green curve) after the January 2017 split.
                The plot shows that the model accurately captures the steady upward trend in monthly deaths and maintains good predictive performance beyond the fitting window. Panel (b) displays the corresponding cumulative mortality curves, 
                again demonstrating close agreement between observed data and the model’s fitted trajectory during the training period, as well as strong predictive alignment in the cross-validation period. 
                Together, the two panels illustrate that the calibrated model reproduces both the short-term and long-term mortality dynamics with high fidelity, validating its reliability for forecasting and policy experimentation.

                while the lower plots show how early reductions in this parameter can significantly flatten mortality curves. 
                Together, the figure highlights how different parameter choices and timing of intervention influence the trajectory of opioid-related deaths.

                revealing that higher intervention efficacy and greater compliance substantially reduce both the peak crime burden
                and long-term criminal activity compared to scenarios with low compliance.
